        <p>He is popularly known by his stage name Ken as a member of SB19 and by his mononym Felip as a solo artist. He is not just an artist but a CEO of his own clothing brand called Superior Son. He was born on January 12, 1997 in Zamboanga Del Sur and was raised in Cagayan de Oro, Philippines. Music has always been a part of his life; he grew up singing and playing instruments in a small church run by his grandfather in his hometown in Mindanao. He had a deep voice and can play a guitar and piano. On the other hand, he only became aware of his dancing skills by chance when he had to dance for a school project. He originally wanted to be an architect but he sacrificed his education to take the opportunity to audition in a boy group. He had no money at that time but one of his co-member Josh is the one who spend for his plane ticket to travel to Manila. Luckily, he is accepted for audition and became one of the members of SB19. He is the main dancer and lead vocalist in their group.</p>
